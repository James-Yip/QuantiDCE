Yeah, I was in a huge hurry and didn't have much but I really needed to make it to the bank before it closed.
I wish I could more often, but it rarely happens. Especially during the summer. My yard grows like literal weeds.
Lol, you and me both. You could always marry a Kardashian!
Well, for the most part it's my family. My husband, kids and pets. I know they're not deaf and it's frustrating!
Yes, that's true. I still can imagine when he was waking up Christmas morning to see what Santa brought when he was 5.
It was a mustang. I saved up enough money and purchased it outright
No i somehow managed to escape.. it was so scary
I cared for it myself. Now she's my beloved cat, Muffin.
Right. Did he at least apologize for the long wait
Yeah, it was weird, the caterer was a woman so I can't imagine it was like a sexism thing, but she responded to me almost instantly every time.
She's doing great, especially for her second week on the job!
Yes, it is. I know that time heals.
The company is downsizing and cutting a lot of departments. His hasn't been cut yet but there are rumors!
I had time that I did not share with the children and that was something that was pending in my soul
She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!
We went camping and she prepared everything rather quickly including the tents
It was great! He has saved for so long to buy it.
I stood there speechless for a moment, turned back and ran for my life!
I'm 29 years old and I woke up to find that I'd wet the bed last night. I'm...not even sure how. I didn't drink a whole lot before bed or anything.
Money mostly. I just wish i could have enough of it to be set for life.
I'm definitely excited. The house just now got built and I saw it for the first time last Monday.
I would cry the first day of school every year, especially the milestone years. Now my grandchildren are starting school. Time flies by too quickly
yes it does but we always got or memories.
There are skydiving centers all over the world.  What part of the country are you in?  It is an amazing sport.
That's great. It sounds like a very good situation to be in.
5 months to find out !
I feel so lucky to have her as a sister-in-law and a friend.  She is always there to offer a supporting ear and encouraging word.
Oh my god..I had doctors really mess me up too. I am in a lawsuit. Have you thought about contacting an attorney?
Yes, its hard but I try to remember he does it for our family! I have been trying to adapt to enjoying alone time.
Yes! I'm excited for that as well. I watched the movie with my mom when it first came out!
It was, kind of hot but not enough to complain about.
Like he jumped out from behind a door and scared me. I was not expecting it!
Im sorry to hear that. Were you born there?
I think I will need to do that, my TV is an oldy.  I am sure you will have a great time.
I was able to go home, but I realize now that I didn't even have to
No, it turns out the power had went out for a minute and it was the sound of the printer calibrating.
Very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and FaceTime. We spent a fortune on telephone calls. But it was so worth it to speak to each other and I was lucky I could afford to fly out to see him.
Yes, but bhe bruised her wrist, and had a concussion. I wish that I was there for her when it happened.
Yeah, my bath wasn't deep enough, so I didn't get covered all the way!
It looked so horrible. I thought for sure the baby was as good as dead.
Yes, it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans, which are delicious!
No, everyone's so busy with their lives and work that it's hard to arrange. Most of the people here my age do drugs or stay out all night, so I keep to myself at home, alone.
Thanks, now all I got to do is get a real career. I couldn't have done it with out them.
I guess I shouldn't expect so much from them and let myself get let down like I have.
It was Blackjack.  I didn't win anything though.
I was SO mad! I felt so bad being mad at him
Multiple bags of chips, to be sure!  *chuckle*
Man that sounds really stressful...
I'm taking everything, honey, raw garlic, yogurt, EVERYTHING!
Yes! i love him so dad, but i feel like my own achievement since i teach him how to play, he dedicated the three goals to me!
It was in person. We mostly interviewed in a conference room, then we took a lab tour afterwards.
No, I do not live in Alabama. We drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance
I am teaching at a small private school, so I will be teaching all the subjects for 3rd grade. I am pretty excited, just nervous.
What a dream come true for you that'll be.
Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.
So did it result in a brawl?
not recently but gettting last at a race really makes me angry and motivates me
It's easier if you had 12 different baby mamas, that's my trick anyway. This last labour was 6 hours long!
You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.
Yes and also Sega Genesis. We play these on the xbox one though via emulation
Maybe so, they say to imagine the crowd naked, but I don't think that helps too much with the writing part.
As I was sitting on the toilet I kept hearing a scratching noise.  When I turned to look a huge waterbug had climbed up the tub wall next to me.
Going to Kazakhstan. That's where i was born. My parents still live there and i miss them so much
Wow that is a great prize! Is she able to take anyone with her or is it just a ticket for one person?
haha are you serious? Did you move in with your girlfriend?
I sure hope so! He's in the military so I never know when he'll get called on a mission :(
She's fine now. I spent a month in the hospital with her, then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab. She was out spreading sacrificial lamb's blood in the water on a fishing trip. Gotta love her.
It is really could to see friends live out their dreams! I will be cheering for him and the team!
She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.
Fortunately no- she cleaned it up. But she had just had spaghetti and it was floating in it. It was so gross!
No, I do not live in Alabama. We drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance
The flu sure makes it feel like you're dying haha
I'll be praying for her, I hope she continues to stay in the clear in the future.
Yeah, he will eat or drink whatever he finds in the fridge.
I agree. It was a bit foolish on my part and I don't want to risk myself nor be worried again. Thanks for the advice.
Hahahaha! Well, I guess we can make light of even our worst moments.
I'm really happy about it- she's a great friend and she's turning 40, so it's a big one!
Awesome!!
I made a bet that he would not lose 20 pounds in 3.5 months. I was hoping that he would win the bet, but on the bright side I got a switch :) Win-win for me.
I do, I have a 6 month old boy. How about you?
I've been to Florida many times before so it wears on you.
Yeah, hopefully so.  It isn't healing correctly is the problem or else I would just go in my cast.
It was so scary! Luckily, it was actually my shadow! The light made my shadow show up, but it first appeared to be an intruder!
I sure did! the ocean and the breeze gives me such a sense of joy and calm
It was a really rough pregnancy that ended with a very painful surgery. It was not pretty, but definitely worth it. I would have taken any amount of pain as long as my son was born healthy and safe.
I have been preparing for weeks, but in the back of my mind I still have doubts.
Awe yeah thanks. He's pretty soft even though he some derpy eye that point in opposite directions. Brings me a lot of comfort and reminds me that someone cares.
Potentially Alaska -- Anchorage, to be specific. We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam, Zurich, and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state, it feels foreign somehow!
It's hard watching one of your parents get sick. We were at the movie theater when I found out and I had to leave.
Nope. They bought them out at city valued tax prices and they have 60 days to find another place to live.
Imagine Dragon and Grace Vanderwhall, do you know them?
Child's play is right, the kid is only 6 years old. And you couldn't have, because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large, which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.
have my own restaurant
I usually love mine, but not when it is keeping me from sleeping

No. We've had a group text going for several years so we just all decided it had been too long.
Yes, my husband even cooked dinner for me today, and helped clean the house! He has been very helpful today.
No all my family lives out of state. I didn't feel like traveling, but I just ended up sitting at home and watching lord of the rings in the dark.
It's ok.  I'm basically over it now, but it was really angering then.
He'll be here in about 3 months
I know! they  grow up so fast! I feel like i just gave a birth to him and look at him now
Uh oh, did he destroy something? Sounds as though he misbehaved a bit.
Thanks, I hope I am. You sound like one too
I started out with one hit wonders but ended up at Pac. I miss my youth lol
She is a normal A-B student and just started 8th grade
We broke up back in May, he was just too much of a workaholic.
I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.
It's hard watching one of your parents get sick. We were at the movie theater when I found out and I had to leave.
She really is
It's like if I don't get that sorted out I won't be able to live a fulfilling life
I know, I will have to be more careful next time. I shouldn't eat ice-cream while driving,
Lots of little stuff.  They love to draw me pictures, crack jokes, and give lots of kisses.
It was! I was the only one around so all the cats came to spend time with me
Maybe a pontoon boat, depends on what they have. Should be a nice way to unwind.
I did! The company does something that I actually like -- a panel interview vs a series of one-on-ones. Have you ever had an interview like that?
Huh, well maybe he is starting his campaign lol
Thanks! It is my final exam for a summer class studying Database Design. I actually should be taking it right now.
yeah i got into another college that was not as good haha
It was such a stunning show. Lin manuel should get a grammy for this
college, but i will be seeing him very soon i think
Right? And no having to interact with others unless we choose too.
That's a good idea. Maybe I'll try that soon.
Mambo #5, Missy Elliot, and Ricky Martin. It really took me back
My room was messy as there was a party last night in my house and friends were enjoying in whole house. That is the reason.
Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.
Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo.
Well In September, Universal Studios starts their Halloween Horror Nights events, after dark!  It's so much fun I can't wait to grab tickets.
Yikes! Why are some people such inconsiderate creeps? It makes me really mad!
Thanks! We are getting coffee this weekend. Hopefully something comes of it!
They were dishonest and physically cruel. We have gone our separate ways, but I truly hope they can learn to treat others better.
That's fine, its not your problem. i just feel very lonely right now.
I was about school. And I eventually confessed.
I practice boxing. I love to punch the sandbags.It is very therapeutic.
I ended up watching Impractical Jokers
He had fallen and bruised his ribs. I had to take him to the hospital.
LOL! Can  you run out and get another pie before she gets home?
Thanks! Being on a diet is hard, espically with family in town!
I'm coping with it. So many memories with her
We've been great with change, including a few overseas moves under our belts. But this is to Anchorage! I've read a lot, and there's a lot to be excited about -- but man, those looooong winters!
Environmental engineering! I enjoy it, but I wouldn't say it is my passion in life.
Yea, enought to have great weekened anyway.
gaming has blown up this past couple of years
Minecraft and asphalt racing are two of them, It's amazing to watch a child learn and grow their intelligence.
She bought me a car
Not really, I take my daughter to see them, so many of them have no visitors at all.
Good, one should always be positive
I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.
No, only my pride was injured.
That is insane! I've never heard of anything like that before.  You all should start protesting!
The cashier couldn't help it. The store should hire more people.
