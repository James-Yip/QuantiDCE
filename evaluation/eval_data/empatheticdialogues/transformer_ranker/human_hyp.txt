oh well you lived through it!
When is it?
Yes, and you will succeed eventually.
Glad you had fun. What breed is it?
your husband is a lucky guy!
That would be great! It would certainly save you from having to buy a new car for a while.
What kind of dog was it?
That's very kind of you. Too often people neglect stray animals and they suffer terrible short lives.
I hope you keep it forever.
Ah ok. Good you stayed committed to your wife.
That is awesome, good luck
She is probably working hard to provide a better life for the family.
What kind of job is it?   I will keep my fingers crossed he gets it!
That sounds good!
Please tell me you caught him!! That is awful!!
Sounds amazing! What kind of art does she want to produce?
That is great. Did you buy him a present for graduation?
sounds super scary! my god.
That's great! You have to keep a good attitude about it. I hope you get the part you want!
Good for you.What is the reason of all this happiness?
How much is the house?
I have those kinds of feelings as well. I think memories are a good thing though
That's awesome. That's a good amount for a little effort which is always nice.
It does just bring about a great feeling doesn't it?
well, as long as you're happy
That is the confidence to have!
Oh, that does not seem very nice.
Sounds cool! There isn't anything like that around here.
it is so nice to see a marriage as strong these days!
Nice you must feel pretty lucky
I bet so. I've never done anything like that before.
That's so sweet!  I bet he is an awesome dad!

Oh sorry to hear that.. Don't you like florida?
Oh my god. That's so scary!
That's great! I went on a nice trip too
That sad. I hope she is okay.
Sounds like somebody needs an accountabili-buddy...

Ford makes some pretty nifty cars! I have a Ford Focus myself. Not much, but it has killer gas mileage.
I have a friend like that. We lose touch but we will always be great friends.
Good for you. Many are getting into car loan and struggling with car payments

Oh, well hopefully that works. Wouldn't want you up all night!

Wow!  That is impressive!  You must be really prod of yourself!
You will grow to love it. Football is amazing sport. Your son will love it.
So you must have prepared well for it. I hope you get the job!
Oh, sometimes you just have to accept weather changing your plans. I am sure you can go another time.
That's great!  What finally convinved the boss?
Oh nice. What color is it?
Wow, that's some high praise, I might just have to try it out myself!
That is so sweet of him, those are the people we need more of in the world
That is the illusion of winning when in reality you are expected to lose
Amazing! Congratulations. When so many children have issues, it is always great to see one that is healthy and well.
I do hate flooding as well
I don't know much about video games but remember playing Mario and games on a Nintendo 64.
Yes! life is a blessing, and we need to make the most of every day.
That is so terrible! was this recent? if you dont mind me asking
Nice! You sound like you prepared very well
Aw, well you can't win everything. Be happy for her!

Wow...You need to find a new place to live because that's completely unreasonable.
Wow! That is really impressive!
Oh, sometimes you just have to accept weather changing your plans. I am sure you can go another time.
Aw I hate to hear that. I also hope she feels better. I love my dog so much.
I hope she was able to fend for herself. I'm sorry she went through that loss.
I know that feeling but I crashed my car my dad bought for me like 1 year later. But that feeling of happiness was awesome!
Was the drive a necessary one to take?
I am such a lucky guy to have a friend like you
Parties are so much fun! Are you celebrating anything special, or is the party just a get together?
It's awful when you spend money on tickets and popcorn and it's a bad time. Did they put all of the best moments in the trailer?
Wow I love nintendo, you should get an NES classic!
Nice. I love finding old stuff from my childhood.
Oh awesome, what part of Florida?
I'm glad you found a job quick! That must have felt a little good to tell them at least
Thank goodness! Yeah, I only watch scary movies in the daytime!
oh, did you enjoy it? I love going to the beach
That's an amazing feat. Studying is kind of a chore for me.
Wow, good luck.  I hope it all goes well. It sounds like you're confident that it will. Have you done one before?
Same I've put my parents through a lot.  But now I'm trying to be the best version of myself so I can eventually pay them back
Awesome, you'll be able to make friends at work. I wish you the best in your new city, congrats!
Then maybe you should think about trying to find a job somewhere else?
It is unbelievable to meet these wild animals in a city. You should definitely call them
Awesome, I hope you have a great time at the concert.
If you live under his roof then you should obey him.
I am glad you got some things done! Now you can rest
Wow, that cat must have loved that shoe, he wanted it
If you live under his roof then you should obey him.
That's great you are happy with where you are in life. I think the place we work and the area in which we live make a big difference.
You will climb high in the company with that good attitude.
How long have you been with your boyfriend?
Wow, you're so well spoken.
My dog needs some good training!
That's great to hear, I hope his first day goes well!
i enjoy a little rain every once in a while, but i dont like thunderstorms either
That is really cool, everyone should do something like that

it is indeed, learning things at young age is a boon. you got an exceptional daughter
Good to hear, glad you guys are happy!
Oh well that sounds like it ended well at least. What was the fight about?
Then maybe you should think about trying to find a job somewhere else?
Its great you trust an awesome woman
Its good to have supportive siblings like you
Oh my!  I am glad to hear you managed to avoid the collision.
Did you do anything special to honor it?
Wow, that must be quite some distance then! Have a safe flight!
Is there anything else you do besides work? A hobby you enjoy, video games, music, working out?
Good job, keep on moving up!
Yeah, that is a good thing he found it and not someone else. What are the odds.
Good luck! Hope you do well

I understand it is usually hard moving to a new city leaving some many people and placed behind
Oh cool. I love visiting car shows myself.
That's true. It's nice of you to put yourself in their shoes.
Perhaps she had an upset tummy or something.  Sometimes with dogs it's hard to tell.
I'm sure he will! Best of luck to him!
Hiking and kayaking? Wow! Better pack some trail mix.
Maybe you should child proof the house.
Thats good! I would of been anxious to get out of that place if that happend.
that's sad news, i am sorry for this news you must have been extra drained after coming back from work from that news
Being a punching bag in a relationship is no good. It's a 2 way street. Is your partner doing their part?
Was she mad at you?
I am too.  I don't go out much so maybe you should make sure you do that
Well thats disappointing. Maybe you can find a show similar to it to watch.
Wow good for him. Now he can drive you around.
your husband is a lucky guy!
Well done! What are you going to spend it on?
Aw I am so sorry to hear of your dogs passing. It's hard to lose a pet. We just lost our cat this year.
It sounds like you're patient and prepared to take it. I wish the best for you guys!
Awesome!  I bet that's a really versatile degree, you should be really successful!
Thats what you should do
I love video games. Thats not a bad weekend
Good. I hope you enjoy the game and play well.
You got a good sister!
Nice, you must do whatever you want each day.
Thats what you should do
Wow, that is really thoughtful.
Oh my god, I would have been so embarrassed! How'd you react?
That too bad. They are other work from home opportunities though.
That sounds pretty healthy.  Have you always been this health conscious
